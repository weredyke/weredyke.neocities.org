                           <p>i havent got much going on but while i have a random blurb on my page let me just ramble a little. im guido, long time hobby coder. some of my other hobbies are drawing furries and anime/videogame characters, hardcore music, diy, alternative subcultures, and i want to get into mixing/producing electronic music. its my dream to become a tattoo artist.</p>
						   <p>my goal for this site is to be off social media. i can showcase my art here for people to view it and access it for whatever reason. i also enjoy networking and making friends who are likeminded or talented or just willing to humor me.</p>
						   <p>fundamentally im a leftist and that also reflects in coding my own site. specifically im an anarchist or communist or socialist or whatever you want to call it. im a male lesbo furry/therian kinkster if that explains anything.</p><br>
						   <strong>while you wait...</strong><p>my socials are <a target="_blank" href="https://weredyke.tumblr.com/">weredyke</a> and... nothing else for now</p>
